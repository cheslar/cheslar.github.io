<p>
  Hello! My name is Ryan and I am a 4th year Computer Science Student who is pursuing a minor in Business & Entrepreneurship. I am currently an intern doing software development at a local internet service provider named Alyrica Networks. In my free time, I love to travel and play disc golf at different courses all around the state. After graduation, I hope to continue working for Alyrica as a full time Software Developer.
