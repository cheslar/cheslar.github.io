  About Me:

<p>
  Hello! My name is Ryan and I am a 4th year Computer Science Student who is pursuing a minor in Business & Entrepreneurship. I am currently an intern doing software development at a local internet service provider named Alyrica Networks. In my free time, I love to travel and play disc golf at different courses all around the state. After graduation, I hope to continue working for Alyrica as a full time Software Developer.

<p>
  During my final year of college, I worked with a startup comapany to contribute to their Sports Betting Applicaiton. I developed an advertisement system that allowed the company to seemlessly integrate ads into their app while minimally affecting user experience. Additionally, I designed, prototyped, and implemented multiple user interfaces of the app.

  OSPF Monitoring System:
</h3>
<p>
  While interning at Alyrica Networks, a project that I worked on was a script that could be used to monitor the OSPF status of the access points that were a part of Alyica's network. The script logs into the access points via SSH and runs a command that shows all of the connections and information about the connection. From here, the script parses the response and interprets the status of the access point. This script was put into an Icinga server that will run the script for each access point every 2 minutes. If a bad status is received, it will alert out to one of the company's network engineer so they can address the problem.

  Access Point Monitoring and Repair System:
</h3>
<p>
  While interning at Alyrica Networks, a significant project was creating a system that can monitor the state and active connections to an access point and restart the access point if there are any issues. The script that I wrote pulls information from the access point via SNMP, parses the information, and makes determinations regarding its status. If there is an issue, it will send an alert and then log into the access point and reboot. This reduces the average down time of an errant access point from potentially hours to less than 2 minutes.
